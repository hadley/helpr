Things that the documentation system currently doesn't do, but could:

* Explore using latent dirichlet topic model to provide see also links based on description and details.
* Display hyperlinked keywords
* Look at structure of hannah rd (http://github.com/mislav/hanna) - esp. interactive search
* Main page - display latest changes from CHANGELOG

* Build index of packages and topics when started
* interactive tutorial like http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/
* Use jsmath (http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/) for nice math display

Package page
============

* links to news & changelogs
* demos

Topic page
==========

* "did you mean?" - include list of all topics with the same name in different packages

Examples
========

* Parse examples and add links to functions that are used
* Loupe to display usage
* Ability to send selected expression to R console
* Ability to evaluate all example code and interleave results back in html

Style
=====
