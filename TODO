√ Make RCurl a suggestion
√ Server functions (solr POSTing code) should require("RCurl")

√ Local mode (!i_can_has_internets): should not use RCurl, activates when no
 RCurl, no internet connection, or when asked for by the user.

   if (local_active()) return(FALSE)

   google <- url("http://google.com")
   res <- try({open(google); internet <- TRUE; close(google)}, quiet = TRUE)
   !inherits(res, "try-error")


√ Make a local mode that can be started when helpr needs to be done locally
   local_mode <- local({
     local_mode <- FALSE
     activate <- function()local_mode <<- TRUE
     deactivate <- function() local_mode <<- FALSE
     is_active <- function() local_mode

     list(activate = activate, deactivate = deactivate, is_active = is_active)
   })
   activate_local <- local_mode$activiate
   deactivate_local <- local_mode$deactiviate
   local_active <- local_mode$is_active

* httpd compatibility mode:

     myHanders <- new.env()
     assign('helpr', render_path, myHandlers)
     assignInNamespace('.httpd.handlers.env', myHanders, 'tools')

     # http://localhost:8181/custom/helpr/

 This needs changes to sinartra to make this easy to implement.  A router
 should have a base URL, which is automatically stripped from the incoming
 url, and is automatically added to outgoing URLs for redirect.


√ Move depends to imports (everything apart from rjson), so they don't clutter
 the user's workspace.

 To do this, you need to move them from Depends to Imports in the
 DESCRIPTION, and add @import highlight, sinartra, ... in the package
 documentation rdoc. No function call should have :: in front of it.

* Create helprServr and move all server related code out of helpr and into
 helprServr

* Replace all uses of system curl with RCurl.











indexing packages...
  These don't work
    BoolNet, cwhmisc, epitools, multxpert, networksis, openair, pequod, pgirmess, qtl, simone, TeachingSampling 



Solr
  √index all internal functions of each function
    √add list to source page
  √similar solr?
    √find documents similar to the one looking at
  √return answers
    √more truncation
      √ (smaller results) set to 70 chars
    √just give answer, not from where (no title necessary)
    √highlight results on next page (javascript to inspect for referrer, extract q param and then match)
  √Change Solr params into ?a=5&b=6
  


New
√  loading a package while you wait needs a screen to tell you that
√  change log stuff
√  allow install of single package
√  make the search bar disappear if solr is not available
√  add to topic page what similar functions exist in sidebar
    Solr

Fix Pages
FAIL - find out how to find out if a topic is a function or not without loading the package
  REWORK - reorganized the package page to make it independent.  Also used keywords for grouping.
√ - add in the footer, description, and readme that this is "funded by Revolution Analytics"

Writing
REVIEW - two paragraph description of "why this is helpful" and "why you should use it"



? fix topic space for internal function stuff
