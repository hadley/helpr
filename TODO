Sinatra
=======

 * when error occurs it should display proper error page including traceback
 
 * sending file from disk doesn't work

 - For pages with no author section, the author(s) title on the right hand block should probably be skipped.  There are also other examples of empty sections, e.g. looking at boot::sunspot.

 - Better display for aka information (e.g. the chron package dates page)

 - From the console, ?mean tries to open http://127.0.0.1:29210/library/base/html/mean.html
